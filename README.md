Plan Your Tour is a simple and visually appealing travel-themed website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean homepage layout with a featured travel video, attractive visuals, and a user-friendly interface to create the feel of a modern tour-planning website. The project focuses on front-end design, presenting a smooth structure where HTML handles the content, CSS controls the styling and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Since it requires no backend setup, the website runs directly in any browser, making it easy to explore or customize. This project serves as a great starting point for beginners learning web development or anyone wanting to build and expand a travel-related site. Future enhancements can include mobile responsiveness, multiple pages, image galleries, and dynamic features to create a full-fledged tour-planning platform.
